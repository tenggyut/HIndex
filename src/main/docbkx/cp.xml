  <title>Apache HBase Coprocessors</title>
  <para>The idea of HBase coprocessors was inspired by Google's BigTable coprocessors. The <link
      xlink:href="https://blogs.apache.org/hbase/entry/coprocessor_introduction">Apache HBase Blog
      on Coprocessor</link> is a very good documentation on that. It has detailed information about
    the coprocessor framework, terminology, management, and so on. </para>
